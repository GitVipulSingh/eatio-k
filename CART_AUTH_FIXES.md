# Cart Authentication Fixes

## Issue Fixed ✅

**Problem**: Unauthenticated users could add items to cart and see "Added to cart" notifications even though they weren't logged in.

**Solution**: Added authentication checks before allowing cart operations and implemented a user-friendly login prompt.

## Changes Made

### 1. **Created LoginPrompt Component** (`frontend/src/components/LoginPrompt.jsx`)
- Reusable dialog component for prompting users to log in
- Provides options to log in or sign up
- Clean, user-friendly design with clear messaging
- Navigates to appropriate auth pages when buttons are clicked

### 2. **Enhanced RestaurantDetailPage** (`frontend/src/client/pages/RestaurantDetailPage.jsx`)
- Added authentication state check using `useSelector(state => state.auth)`
- Added `showLoginPrompt` state for controlling login dialog
- Modified `handleQuantityChange()` to check authentication before allowing quantity changes
- Modified `handleAddToCart()` to check authentication before adding items to cart
- Added LoginPrompt component to the JSX with custom message

### 3. **Secured Cart Slice** (`frontend/src/client/store/slices/cartSlice.js`)
- Added `isUserAuthenticated()` helper function to check localStorage for user info
- Enhanced `addToCart` reducer to prevent adding items when not authenticated
- Enhanced `updateQuantity` reducer to prevent quantity updates when not authenticated
- Added `clearCartOnLogout` reducer to clear cart data when user logs out
- Added console warnings when unauthenticated users try to modify cart

### 4. **Added Store Middleware** (`frontend/src/client/store/store.js`)
- Created `cartClearMiddleware` to automatically clear cart when user logs out
- Ensures cart data doesn't persist across different user sessions
- Maintains data integrity and security

## User Experience Flow

### **For Unauthenticated Users:**
1. **Browse restaurants** → Can view menu and restaurant details ✅
2. **Click "ADD" button** → Login prompt appears instead of adding to cart ✅
3. **Try to change quantity** → Login prompt appears ✅
4. **Login prompt options**:
   - **Cancel** → Closes dialog, stays on restaurant page
   - **Sign Up** → Navigates to customer registration page
   - **Log In** → Navigates to login page

### **For Authenticated Users:**
1. **All existing functionality preserved** → No changes to current behavior ✅
2. **Add to cart works normally** → Items added successfully ✅
3. **Quantity changes work normally** → UI updates as expected ✅
4. **Cart persists across sessions** → Until user logs out ✅

## Security Enhancements

### **Frontend Protection:**
- ✅ UI-level checks prevent cart operations for unauthenticated users
- ✅ Redux store-level protection prevents direct state manipulation
- ✅ Cart automatically clears on logout to prevent data leakage
- ✅ Authentication state checked from localStorage and Redux store

### **Data Integrity:**
- ✅ Cart data only persists for authenticated users
- ✅ No cart data mixing between different user sessions
- ✅ Proper cleanup when users log out

## Code Integrity Maintained

### **No Breaking Changes:**
- ✅ All existing functionality for authenticated users preserved
- ✅ No modifications to unrelated components or logic
- ✅ Restaurant browsing still works for unauthenticated users
- ✅ All existing API calls and UI components intact

### **Clean Implementation:**
- ✅ Reusable LoginPrompt component for future use
- ✅ Minimal code changes with maximum security impact
- ✅ Proper error handling and user feedback
- ✅ Consistent with existing code patterns and styling

## Testing Scenarios

### **Scenario 1: Unauthenticated User**
1. Visit restaurant page → ✅ Can view menu
2. Click "ADD" button → ✅ Login prompt appears
3. Click "Cancel" → ✅ Stays on page, no cart changes
4. Click "Log In" → ✅ Redirects to login page

### **Scenario 2: Authenticated User**
1. Visit restaurant page → ✅ Can view menu
2. Click "ADD" button → ✅ Item added to cart successfully
3. Change quantity → ✅ Works normally
4. Add to cart → ✅ Success notification appears

### **Scenario 3: User Logout**
1. User has items in cart → ✅ Cart shows items
2. User logs out → ✅ Cart automatically clears
3. User logs back in → ✅ Cart starts empty (as expected)

## Files Modified

1. **`frontend/src/components/LoginPrompt.jsx`** - New reusable component
2. **`frontend/src/client/pages/RestaurantDetailPage.jsx`** - Added auth checks
3. **`frontend/src/client/store/slices/cartSlice.js`** - Added security measures
4. **`frontend/src/client/store/store.js`** - Added logout middleware

## Summary

✅ **Issue Fixed**: Unauthenticated users can no longer add items to cart  
✅ **User Experience**: Clear, friendly prompts guide users to log in  
✅ **Security**: Multiple layers of protection prevent unauthorized cart operations  
✅ **Code Integrity**: No existing functionality broken or removed  
✅ **Future-Proof**: Reusable components and patterns for similar features  

The cart now properly requires authentication while maintaining all existing functionality for logged-in users.
